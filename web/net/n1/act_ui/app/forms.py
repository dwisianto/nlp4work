He was using filament made of ore from the Midwest. In order to save high shipping cost, Edison decided to open his own ore mining plant nearby. He spent a decade to run the plant smoothly. In spite of all these cumbersome efforts, his project failed due to poor quality of ore on the East Coast. But even then Edison did not quit.'),
